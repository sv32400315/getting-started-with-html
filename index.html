   <strong>BASICS OF THE WEB AND HTML</strong>
<br>
<EM>This is actually the first lesson of the first course 
of this Nanodegree.</EM>
<p>The Instructor is Steve Huffman.  Steve is the cofounder of 
<a href="www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p><strong>World Wide Web</strong>
<br>-collection of HTML <em>(HyperText Markup Language)</em> documents
<br>-glues everything together
<br>-Links between pages are called Hyperlinks
<br>-Invented in the 1990s and there are over 30 billion pages
<br>-HTML is main type of document found on the web</p>
<p><strong>Major Pieces of the Web</strong>
<br><b>HTTP</b>- the main protocol of the web
<br><b>Servers</b>-computers that host
the files that make up the web
<br><b>Internet</b>- the world's largest computer 
<br><b>Browser</b>-a program that runs on your computer 
to display files found on the web.  Examples are Internet 
Explorer, Chrome and Firefox</p>
<p><strong>HyperText Markup Language (HTML)</strong>
<br>-HTML documents contain <em>text content</em> which describes "what you see" 
and <em>markup</em> which describes "how it looks"
<br>-references to other documents. e.g. images and videos
<br>-links to other pages
<br>-during the lesson, the instructor used a simple HTML editor called 
<a href="https://udacity.com/html_playground">HTML Playground</a>
<br>-Plain text is plain text in HTML
<br>-HTML markups made up of tags. 
<br>-An HTML <b>tag</b> is always contained within angled brackets   with both an Opening and closing tag.
There is an opening and closing tag.  The closing tag has a slash. 
<br>An HTML <b>element</b> refers to everything within a set of opening and 
closing tags
<br>-An HTML <b>attribute</b> is a property of an HTML element. The href attribute 
is set to an anchor tag for the URL
<p><strong>HTML Tags</strong>
<br>-no closing tag is needed if no content
<br>-<b>a</b> tag is an anchor tag.  Anchors are for making links
<br>-<b>b</b> tag is used to bold content
<br>-<b>em</b> tag is used to italicize. <b>em</b> stands for emphasize
<br>-<b>img</b> tag are for images.  <b>alt</b> text is used in case
the image does not load.  Alt stands for alternate and is considered a <em>void</em> tag.
<br>-Images do not need closing tags
<br>-<b>br</b> tag stands for break and used to create multiple lines
<br>-<b>p</b> tag stands for paragraph.  The p tag creates an invisible 
box with height and width
<br>-anchor tags use the <em>href</em> attribute
<br>-img tags use the <em>src</em> attribute
<br>-<b>Inline and Block</b>. Inline are a,br, b, em, img, strong and span.  
Block are p, form and div.
<br>-Span and div both can have content.  They do not do anything but contain their content.  
Div act more like a paragraph tag</p>
<strong>HTML Document</strong>
<br>-Complete HTML document has a doctype, opening HTML tag, closing HTML tag, head and body
<br>-Doctype tell what kind of HTML it is.  Used to be more complicated. Now with HTML 5, it is nice and simple
<br>-The section called Head includes meta data and other random stuff.  May also include Java
script and CSS.  In addition, may include title of thpage which is a the top of the browser window
<br>-we have been working on the body tag in the lesson.  Focusing on the content that will be between the body tags

<p><strong>Concepts to Remember</strong>
<br>- <b>How the Web Works:</b> The web is a bunch of computers that communicate with each other.  
When a person goes to a web page like <a href="www.google.com">www.google.com</a>, their computer sends a HTTP 
Request to a server. The server finds the appropriate HTML document and sends it back to the user's computer
where a web browser interprets the page and displays it on the user's screen
<br>- <b>HTML:</b>  HTML stands for <em>Hypertext Markup Language</em>. HTML documents form the majority of the content on 
the web. HTML documents contain text content which describes "what you see" and markup which describes "how it looks"
<br>-<b>Tags and Elements:</b>  HTML documents are made of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type 
of each element by using HTML tags
<br>-<b>Why Computers are Stupid:</b>  Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes 
them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program. 
<br>-<b>Inline vs Block Elements:</b>  HTML elements are either inline or block. Block elements form an "invisible box"
around the content inside of them
